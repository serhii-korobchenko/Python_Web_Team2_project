To delete images in Docker Desktop from your hard disk, you can follow these steps:

Open Docker Desktop and click on the Docker icon in the system tray (Windows) or menu bar (macOS).
Click on "Preferences" (macOS) or "Settings" (Windows) to open the settings window.
Click on the "Resources" tab.
Click on "Images" in the left sidebar to see a list of all the images stored on your hard disk.
Click on the image you want to delete and then click on the "Remove" button. You can also select multiple
images to delete at once.
Confirm that you want to delete the image(s) by clicking on "Yes" when prompted.
Note that deleting images will free up disk space on your hard disk,
but it will also remove the image(s) from Docker Desktop and any containers that depend
on them will no longer be able to run. If you need to use an image again later,
you'll need to download or build it again.
